Doctelligence enters participants into a decentralised intelligence health network via sovereign authentication architectures using public key identities in the setup of healthcare provision. The main participants are health users, spaces, providers and systems. The network's root infrastructure merges an architecture of user permissioned personal health records data access into a real world  node layer of health space to host interoperable provision.                An ERC-20 token accesses federated learning protocols on-chain for systems to train algorithm models on users personal health records    that professionals embed into updated models of health care practice. Users receive token transactions as incentive to participate in federated learning rounds with a long-term roadmap to developing cryptographic-based insurance solutions.
